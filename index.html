        Introduction:  
        Welcome, Traveler! 
        <br><br>
        In the ruins of Elsier, there are rumors of a large treasure being guarded by the Nightfang Dragon, known as Soul Stealer.
        Soul Stealer is an ancient species of dragon with black scales, obsidian-like talons, and silver eyes that can see in the dark
        as if it were daytime.  It is said that Soul Stealer breathes black fire that is able to burn through <e>*almost*</e> anything....
        <br><br>
        You have decided that your training and preparation have readied you for the challenge to venture to the ruins, in hopes of defeating 
        the dragon and obtaining his treasure.  Your have grown up a lot since your youth.  Now, at age 26, you feel you are at your 
        physical peak.  Mentally, you have already taken the leap of faith and prepared your belongings - basic supplies: food, water, armor, 
        a weapon, and a survival kit.  Your father, Edwin, and your Mother, Alena, have raised you well.  Your father taught you how to 
        handle your skills and how to defend yourself.  He spent many nights with you, hiking, camping, and living in the woods.  Your mother 
        taught you how to mend clothes, forage edible foods, and how to take care of your wounds.  
        <br><br>
        But did they prepare you for this?....
